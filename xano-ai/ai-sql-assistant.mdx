<Warning>
## PREVENTING SQL INJECTION ATTACKS

Xano offers some filters to help ensure that any dynamic / user input is not parsed in a way that might harm your database or cause other unintended consequences.

Make sure to process your inputs **before** they are used in any SQL queries with the appropriate filter.

These filters are [sql\_alias and sql\_esc](/the-function-stack/filters/text#sql_alias)

## What can I build with the AI Lambda Assistant?

The Lambda Assistant can be used to write complete Lambda functions to run right alongside the rest of your function stack.

Lambda functions and the AI Assistant can take full advantage of NPM packages, including even finding the ones you might need to write your desired function. Just plug in your idea and go.

<Steps>
<Step title="Give the assistant context by running your function stack first.">
If you don't do this, you can still use the AI assistant, but it will make certain inferences that may not be correct.
</Step>
<Step title="Look for the AI Assistant button and click it to enable the assistant.">

<Step title="Ask the assistant for help as needed.">

In this example, we're asking the assistant to write a function that imports the Decamelize library and applies it to our 'test' input.

You can click

to add the suggestions to the Lambda function code, or you can copy it manually and place it as needed.

Be sure to **rate the assistant's suggestion(s)** using the 👍 and 👎 buttons. We'll use this information to improve the behavior of the assistant in future iterations.

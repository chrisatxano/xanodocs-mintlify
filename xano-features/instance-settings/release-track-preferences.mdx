<Info>
Release track preferences are only available on our paid plans.

</Info>

<Warning>
Please note that emergency patches or updates may override your release track preferences.

</Warning>

From your Instance settings panel, you have the ability to define when Xano updates are applied to that instance. This is helpful if you want to only deploy updates to a specific maintenance window that makes sense for your application, or schedule testing after an update is applied.

* Click the ⚙️ icon next to your instance, and choose **Release Track** from the panel that opens.

* Choose between the available release track options, depending on your plan.

  * **Immediate (default)** will deploy new releases to your instance as soon as they are available.

  * **Flexible** allows you to specify a maintenance window for when releases are applied to your instance.

    * **Maintenance Window** allows you to choose a timeframe that the update can be applied.

    * **Preferred release days** is available as well if you want to only install updates on specific days of the week.

  * **Manual (enterprise only)** allows for full manual control of update deployment

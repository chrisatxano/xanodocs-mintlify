## Before You Proceed

<Steps>
  <Step title="Changing server regions will change your API base URL">
    Your instance has a specific URL, such as https://abc1-def2-ghi3.xano.io/ and all of your API endpoints begin with this.

    When you change regions, because you are migrating to a new server, your base URL will change.

    After selecting your new server region, you will be given an option to begin the migration, so you have time to update anything necessary before proceeding.

    <Warning>
      **Be sure to update any external connections with the new URL prior to initiating the migration.**
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Unpublished drafts will NOT be migrated">
    Make sure to publish anything you want to save before proceeding.

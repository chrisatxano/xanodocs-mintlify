Snippets are an easy way to share API endpoints with the Xano community. When you share a Snippet it will be available for anyone to add to their own workspace.

Snippets contain all components related to the API endpoint. You can edit or add to what is included in this Snippet. **No one will have access to your workspace**.

You can see Snippets that have been created by the Xano community at [xano.com/snippet](https://www.xano.com/snippet/). You can preview a Snippet in an anonymous account to try it out or add it to an existing instance.

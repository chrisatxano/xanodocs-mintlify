Xano allows you to collaborate on projects by adding a team member to your instance. Be sure to check your plan to see if additional team members are included.

### Add a Team Member

From the instance page, find the instance that you wish to add a team member. Click the menu icon and select **Manage Team**.

Only the owner of the instance can add additional team members.

**Make sure your team member has already signed up for a Xano account** (a free account is perfectly fine). Enter the email address the team member uses for their Xano account. Then choose the role of admin or developer for the team member.

### Team Member Roles

***Owner**** *is the owner of the instance. You have full control over who has access to the instance and what roles someone will have.

* Admin - full access to everything including the ability to manage team members.

* Developer - full access to everything except managing team members.

* Read-only - read-only access to everything except for actions like workspace export and run & debug.

* Suspended - no access at all, but still a team member (this tends to be a temporary state, so you can switch back without having to re-invite the user).

_**Agency**_ *is a special role, which gives admin rights to members of the [Agency](/team-collaboration/managing-team-members#undefined).

An email will be sent and once the team member accepts the invitation, they can log in using their own credentials and access your instance.

### Remove a Team Member and Update Roles

By selecting one of the team members you are able to either update their role or remove them from instance access.

### Manage an Agency

*Agency *is a special role, which is designated when you have accepted an invitation from a Xano Agency plan instance. The Agency role is designed for full-service management. Meaning any team members attached to the Agency plan instance will have admin rights to your instance.

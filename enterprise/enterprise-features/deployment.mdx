## Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)
If your organization already operates with a tested and approved Cloud Provider, Xano can be deployed on other providers such as AWS, Azure, or another Google Cloud instance. Each Xano Instance will be hosted within your own cloud account. This provides complete control and access to all of your data and infrastructure. BYOC includes Data Sovereignty, Regional Support, Scaling Configurations, direct access to all resources through RBAC, and the ability to host unlimited Xano instances\* within the GCP account. (*\*Separate licenses are required for each Xano instance*).

## On-Premise

On-premise cloud computing means that an organization uses its own physical infrastructure to deploy cloud resources, ensuring high levels of security. Each Xano Instance will be hosted within your on-premise environment. This option is reserved for organizations that require the utmost security standards.

## Highly Available Edition (Multi-zone Configuration)
Highly Available Edition is recommended for critical production applications or any application needing to minimize downtime and increase reliability. Xano configures multiple zones to ensure continuous operations without failing for a designated period of time. Multi-Zone Configuration helps provide redundancy with data backups across zones, failover capabilities, and automatic recovery. These play an essential role in ensuring organizations meet their availability goals and SLAs. In the event of an outage in one zone, another zone is automatically able to take over helping prevent data loss and maximizing application resiliency.

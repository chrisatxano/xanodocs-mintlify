## Use a Pre-built Action

Xano Actions are available for you to import directly into your workspace and enable messaging features, such as sending Slack messages.

Click on any of the Actions below to try it out and add it to your workspace.

<Info>
  **Why is the Marketplace not enabled by default?**

  We are in the process of phasing out this version of the Marketplace in favor of Xano Actions and related features. You can still use the Marketplace, and anything you utilize there will not disappear, but please note that some Marketplace extensions may not be up to date. We're working hard to bring you a better experience here.

## Build Your Own

You can also build your own messaging functions by using our [External API Request](/the-function-stack/functions/apis-and-lambdas/external-api-request) function and following the API documentation available for your service of choice. Some popular options are linked below for your convenience.

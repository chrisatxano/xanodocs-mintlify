title: "External Database Query"
---

In Xano, you can connect to the following types of external databases:

* PostgreSQL
* MS SQL
* Oracle
* MySQL

Add a new function to your function stack that corresponds to the type of database you'd like to connect to. The external connection functions are located under Database Operations.

Once you've added your desired connection function, you'll need to define a **connection string**. A connection string is just a URL that contains all of the information we need to connect to your database, such as a hostname or IP address, port, username, and password. We've added an easy to use panel to help you generate a connection string for your database.

Fill in the required information and click **Save** at the bottom to generate your connection string.

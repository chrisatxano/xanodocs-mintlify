## Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a robust search engine designed for quick and efficient data retrieval in applications. It handles diverse data types, employs a distributed architecture, and offers a powerful query language for real-time search needs. Integration into your applications enhances search experiences, enabling developers to implement efficient full-text searches and complex queries. Elasticsearch's indexing capabilities make it valuable for applications such as monitoring systems, log analysis tools, and other scenarios requiring fast and relevant data access.

**Below is a video for our OpenSearch functionality, which can be used as a reference when working with our Elasticsearch functions; they are largely the same.**

Xano offers a few functions to make Elasticsearch requests simple.

* [Elasticsearch: Query Wizard](/the-function-stack/functions/cloud-services#elasticsearch-query-wizard-function)
* [Elasticsearch: Document](/the-function-stack/functions/cloud-services#elasticsearch-document-crud-function)
* [Elasticsearch: Request](/the-function-stack/functions/cloud-services#elasticsearch-request)

## Connect to Elasticsearch

Requires an Elasticsearch domain.

1. `auth_type`<br/>Choose between `Basic` , `Bearer` or `API Key` to set the type of authentication process to use.
2. `key_id`<br/>If using `Basic`, enter the username you wish to authenticate with.<br/>If using `Bearer`, leave this blank.<br/>If using `API Key`, enter the API key identifier you wish to authenticate with.
3. `access_key`<br/>If using `Basic`, enter the API key secret you with to authenticate with.<br/>If using `Bearer` , no access key is required.<br/>If using `API Key` , enter the value that corresponds with the key identifier you wish to authenticate with.
4. `base_url`<br/>Set to the domain endpoint where Elasticsearch is hosted.
5. `index`<br/>Enter the name of the Elasticsearch index to send request.<br/>Only applicable on Document and Query functions.

## Elasticsearch Query Wizard Function

Use the query wizard to easily search documents stored in Elasticsearch.

### Configure

See [Connect to Elasticsearch](/the-function-stack/functions/cloud-services#connect-to-elasticsearch) for details on configuration.

Then, select a `return_type` from the options below.

* `search` - Returns records that match query
* `count` - Returns number of total records matching query

### Query

**Query Wizard**

Set filter criteria using the Xano query builder. The left input is the field to filter on. Then set the operator and value to evaluate. Optionally, add multiple conditions using AND / OR logic.

Select ‘Update Payload’ to ensure your changes are reflected in the query payload.

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/bd3e7c3d-image.jpeg" />
</Frame>

**Output Options**

These options can only be set on ‘search’ return type (not ‘count’).

Size: the number of results to return (useful for pagination)

From: the number to offset the results (useful for pagination)

Included Fields: field names to include in the results. Can be formatted as JSON array or comma separated string.

Sort: order to return results. Default is by Elasticsearch relevance score. Option to choose one or more fields to sort in ascending or descending order.

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/fb67f6b5-image.jpeg" />
</Frame>

**Payload (auto-generated)**

The JSON sent as the payload to Elasticsearch. This is generated by the Query Wizard and Output Options sections. Useful for debugging.

Dynamic values (variables, inputs, etc.) are escaped using parentheses and use Xano expression syntax. These will be evaluated at the time of the request.

Changes made directly to the payload may be overwritten by other areas of the query wizard. If you already have a query payload you want to use, it is recommended to use the Elasticsearch Request function instead.

Set the `url` to use the desired endpoint of the request.

Set `query` to the JSON payload if necessary.

## OpenSearch

OpenSearch is an open-source search and analytics tool suite, derived from ElasticSearch, offered as a scalable and flexible solution by Amazon Web Services.

With OpenSearch, you can apply natural language processing, text analyzers, and built in machine learning to quickly return the most relevant data. This makes it a great tool for log analytics, application monitoring, and website searches.

<Info>
Turn your API endpoint into a redirect to the file by returning the data field from the return variable and setting a custom header of Content-Type with the mime of the file resource.

</Info>

Here's an example return of Create Variable from File Resource:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/126437d4-image.jpeg" />
</Frame>

If we return the raw image (data) and use a Set Header function to define `Content-Type` the mime (in this example `image/png`). We can have our endpoint URL redirect to the file.

## Microsoft Azure Blob Storage

Manage storage containers from your Microsoft Azure account directly from the Xano function stack.

### Setup

Please ensure you have a Microsoft Azure account. If you don't yet have an account [sign up to Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/azure-portal) and navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).

#### Create a storage account

A storage account is required to store files on Azure. First, select **Create a resource** from the portal homepage.

<Frame caption="Select Create a resource from the portal home page.">
  <img src="/images/e58718e9-image.jpeg" />
</Frame>

Navigate to storage and select **Create** under storage account.

<Frame caption="Create a storage account.">

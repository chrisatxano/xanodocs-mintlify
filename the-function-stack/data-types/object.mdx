title: "Object"
---

Think of a JSON object like a labeled container system - similar to how you might organize items in your kitchen. Just as you store different ingredients in containers with clear labels, a JSON object stores information with descriptive labels. The descriptive label is known as a **key**, and the value itself is referred to as **value**.

Objects can also contain separate complex data types in each key, such as arrays.

```json
{
    "recipeName": "Chocolate Chip Cookies",
    "cookingTime": 12,
    "ingredients": [
                        "flour",
                        "sugar",
                        "chocolate chips"],
    "isGlutenFree": false
}
```

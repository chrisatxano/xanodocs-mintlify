## What is Xano?

Xano is, at its core, a visual development platform for building backend solutions. Think of the backend as the powerhouse behind your application or website that handles all of the heavy lifting, data processing, and workflows.

## What can I use Xano for?

Xano is inherently very flexible. Here's what some of our users are utilizing Xano for:

* Complete backend systems
* Connecting multiple services together
* A data warehouse
* Supplementing an existing system (building and deploying microservices)

## How can I generate a backend using AI?

* **Getting Started Assistant**
  * When you create a new workspace in Xano, our Getting Started Assistant will take your idea and generate a database, tables, user authentication, and even basic API endpoints that you can use right away.

* **Database Assistant**

  * After you've started working in Xano, you can continue the conversation with our Database Assistant, designed to talk through and perform updates to your database and tables. Let it know what changes you want to make, review each suggestion for accuracy, and apply them with one click.

* **SQL Assistant**

  * Now that your backend is up and running, maybe you'd like to add some additional, more complex database queries to your APIs. Our SQL Assistant can take your idea, generate a query to retrieve exactly the data you're looking for, and even display a list of results to make sure it's exactly what you need.

* **Lambda Assistant**

  * Our Lambda Assistant is designed to help you write and iterate on Lambda functions. It can take a prompt and generate code for you, with context of the rest of your function stack, as well as importing any external NPM packages required. This is useful for scenarios where you'd like to add features to your backend that Xano doesn't support natively, such as image manipulation or PDF generation.

  **How Xano AI handles your data**

  Your data stays yours. We process it to generate AI responses but don't store it or use it to train our models. Third parties that help run our AI only collect basic usage data for billing.

  **You can view our full AI Terms & Conditions&#x20;**[**here**](https://legal.xano.com/ai-terms)**.**

## How does Xano compare to other tools?

At a high level, Xano is a complete backend platform with a focus on visual development. That means that we don't just focus on the database, nor do we just focus on workflows, and a technical background is not required.

Xano also adopts a flat monthly pricing structure, which means that you never have to worry about overages or surprises.

    **What happens if I cancel my subscription?**

    You will continue to retain access to Xano until the end of your subscription period.

    **What is Xano's refund policy?**

    Xano does not offer refunds on monthly plans. We may offer a refund on a yearly subscription during the first thirty days depending on the circumstances. Refunds are not processed automatically upon cancellation; you need to reach out to our support team **before you cancel** to process your request.

    **Can I downgrade back to a free plan?**

    Due to technical limitations in our current infrastructure, it is not currently possible to directly downgrade from a paid plan back to a free plan.

## Quick Summary

The Xano MCP Server allows you to interact with your Xano instance and workspaces using MCP. This enables you to do things like...

* Create database tables and update table schema

* Generate sample data

* Parse and search your request history

...all from your favorite MCP client, such as Claude, Cursor, or Windsurf.

The Xano MCP Server is powered by our [Metadata API](/xano-features/metadata-api), and we expect to eventually allow for all of the methods present there to be used as tools within the Xano MCP Server.

Connect to the Xano MCP Server from your instance settings -> **Metadata API & MCP Server**

## What is the Xano MCP Server?

The Xano MCP Server, powered by our [Metadata API](/xano-features/metadata-api), enables you to interact with your Xano instance and workspaces without leaving your favorite MCP client.

## Connecting to the Xano MCP Server

<Steps>
<Step title="From the Instance selection screen, click the ⚙️ icon next to your instance, and choose Metadata API & MCP Server" />
<Step title="Generate an Access Token">
Access Tokens are used for authentication when connecting to the Xano MCP server. For more information on generating access tokens, see this reference: [Generate an Access Token](/xano-features/metadata-api#generate-an-access-token)
</Step>
<Step title="Choose your connection method">
For most clients, at this time, SSE is likely the method that you'll want to choose. However, we have made a streaming connection available as well. Click the URL to copy it to your clipboard.
</Step>
<Step title="Connect using your client of choice">

For more information on connecting your clients to an MCP server, refer to [Connecting Clients](/ai-tools/mcp-builder/connecting-clients) or to your client's documentation for the most up to date information.

The instructions linked above are for connecting an MCP server built using Xano's MCP builder, but are fundamentally the same for the Xano MCP Server — just replace the URL with what you copied in step 3.

<Step title="Choose the workspace you'd like to transfer, and the instance to transfer it to.">

</Frame>

<Info>
If you don't see your client's instance available, make sure they've accepted their [Client Invite](/agencies/agency-features/client-invite) and purchased the suggested plan.
</Info>

This will create a **copy** of the workspace and transfer that copy to your client's instance.

You should proceed with any additional work by accessing the client's instance directly, as any further changes you make on your own copy of the workspace will not transfer.
</Step>

<Warning>
For larger workspaces, transferring this way may not be possible. If you run into trouble, please reach out to support so we can process the migration for you.

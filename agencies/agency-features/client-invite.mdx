</Step>
<Step title="Provide the client's name and email, and choose the scenario that applies to them.">

Let us know if this is a new Xano customer, if they have a current account and just need to upgrade their plan, or if they're an existing Xano customer already on a paid plan that will suit their needs.

By choosing **New Xano Customer** or **Upgrade Xano Customer**, you'll be able to let them know the plan that you recommend next. If you choose **Existing Xano Customer**, the invite will send right away.

Just select the plan they need and click **Send Proposal to Client**

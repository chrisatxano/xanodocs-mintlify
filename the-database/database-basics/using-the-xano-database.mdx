    Click
    <Frame caption="">
      <img src="/images/11721c7f-image.jpeg" />
    </Frame>
    in the top right corner.

    Choose **Import Data** to [import data from a CSV file](/the-database/migrating-your-data/csv-import-and-export), or **Enter Data Manually** to start with an empty table where you can add your own data later, or generate sample data automatically.
    <Tip>
    If you're just starting out, we'd recommend choosing **Enter Data Manually** and using the sample data generator. You can always import data later.

    </Tip>

    In the panel that opens, give your table a <Tooltip tip="When naming your table, it's considered best practice to use camelCase for multiple words, and to not use plurals in the table name. For example, a table of dog breeds would be named dogBreed">name</Tooltip> and a <Tooltip tip="The description is just for you to make notes on what this table will contain, notable data constraints, or any other information you'd like to store.">description</Tooltip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Give your table a name and a description.">
    When naming your table, it's considered best practice to use camelCase for multiple words, and to not use plurals in the table name. For example, a table of dog breeds would be named `dogBreed`

    The description is just for you to make notes on what this table will contain, notable data constraints, or any other information you'd like to store.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your primary key type.">
    The primary key is the ID of each record. Xano offers two types of primary keys to choose from.

    <Info>
      **When should you use Sequential, and when should you use UUID?**

      When designing your database structure in Xano, choosing the right identifier type is an important decision. Here's a straightforward guide to help you decide:

      **Sequential IDs are best for:**

      * Performance-sensitive operations - they're faster to index and query

      * Human-friendly references - easier to communicate ("Please check record #42")

      * Storage efficiency - they consume less space in your database

      * When chronological order matters - the sequence reveals creation order

      * Single-database applications where centralized ID generation works well

      * Systems that benefit from predictable numbering patterns

      **Common use cases:** Customer IDs, order numbers, ticket systems, invoice numbers, internal record tracking

      **UUIDs are best for:**

      * Distributed systems where multiple services create records independently

      * Data synchronization across different databases or systems

      * Preventing ID guessing or enumeration attacks

      * Frontend-first workflows where IDs need to be generated before server contact

      * Multi-region deployments with separate databases

      * When you don't want to expose information about record counts

      * Scenarios where data privacy is paramount

      **Common use cases:** User accounts in modern applications, cross-system record tracking, session management, event logging in distributed architectures
    </Info>

    <Info>
      Please note that there is **no support** for converting tables to / from different primary key types. However, this can be done with a manual migration to a new table.
    </Info>
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Sequential (1, 2, 3...)">
      A sequential identifier is just a sequence of whole numbers (1, 2, 3, etc...).

      Think of sequential IDs like numbered tickets at a deli counter. They start at 1 and count up one by one (2, 3, 4...). Just like how the first customer gets ticket #1, the first row in your database gets ID #1. This system is straightforward but requires coordination - just as you can't have two deli counters giving out the same numbers (it would confuse customers), you need to ensure you're not creating duplicate IDs across different parts of your system.

      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="UUID">
      A UUID is like the serial number on your electronics - something like "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000". It's longer and looks random, similar to how no two iPhone serial numbers are alike, even if they were made in different factories. This makes UUIDs particularly useful when you have data coming from multiple sources or need to merge databases - you don't have to worry about ID conflicts, just like how Apple doesn't need to check with Samsung about what serial numbers they're using.

      Some users feel that using UUIDs is also more secure. UUIDs do provide some security benefits through obscurity - you can't easily guess other valid IDs by simply incrementing a number. If a website shows you order #1234, you might guess that order #1235 exists. But if you see order 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000, you can't easily guess other valid orders.

      However, it's crucial to understand that using UUIDs is not a replacement for proper security measures. You should never rely on the difficulty of guessing IDs as your only security mechanism. Proper authentication and authorization should be in place regardless of ID type.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add some tags.">
    Tags in Xano can be applied to any object (tables, APIs, functions, etc...) and are used to easily find related objects when searching your workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose to add basic CRUD endpoints.">
    Xano can provide you with some standard pre-built APIs for basic operations against this table. If you choose this option, you'll also want to supply an **API Group** for those endpoints to live in. You can always choose to generate these endpoints later, too.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm your choices.">
    Once you've confirmed all of your settings are as you want them to be, click **Add Table**.

</Frame>
to add a new field, and choose the [type of field](/the-database/database-basics/field-types) you want to add from the panel that opens.

After you've selected your desired field type, you will be presented with a number of options. You can review each one of them and what they mean below.

| Setting               | Required? | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name                  |     ‚òëÔ∏è   | The name of the field you are creating                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Description           |     ‚òê    | Add additional details here                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Data Structure        |     ‚òëÔ∏è   | **Single** - Each record will only store one value in this field. This is the more common selection. **List** - Each record can hold multiple values in this field. For example, if this was a table of authors, we might have a field that can store multiple books for each author.                   |
| Allow Nullable Values |     ‚òê    | A `null` value is similar to an empty value in that it represents "nothing is here", but it's still an actual value written to the record. Useful if you need to specifically check whether or not that field has data stored.                                                                          |
| Format                |     ‚òê    | For some field types, you can specify a format. This does not change the actual data being stored and is only used to enable easier viewing and editing for you inside of the table view.                                                                                                               |
| Default Value         |     ‚òê    | When adding new records, you can automatically populate a default value **Note: **If your field allows nullable values, they will auto-apply null to new records as a default value. Adding 'null' to the default value field manually will be processed as text and have unintended results. |

<Info>
**Note**

The settings listed below only impact your API endpoints that utilize the database link feature. This means that it is possible to make changes that break these rules via the database table view.

| Sensitive Data         |     ‚òê    | Hide the contents of this field from certain areas, such as request history                                                                                          |
| Column Visibility      |     ‚òê    | **Public** - The field will be available as an input **Private** - This field will not appear in inputs **Internal** - Hide this field from API inputs and responses |
| Custom Rules & Filters |     ‚òê    | See below.                                                                                                                                                           |

#### Custom Rules & Filters

For each field, you can apply various rules and filters to ensure that the data is stored in the format that you expect.

| Filter Name | Purpose                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| min         | Enforces a minimum number of required characters |
| max         | Enforces a maximum number of required characters |
| startsWith  | Enforces a prefix                                |
| endsWith    | Enforces a suffix                                |
| prevent     | Blacklists phrases                               |
| lower       | Stores the value in all lowercase                |
| upper       | Stores the value in all uppercase                |
| alphaOk     | Whitelist certain alphanumeric characters        |
| digitOk     | Whitelist certain numbers                        |

Rename this field

<Warning>
Please note that renaming a field should be handled with care, as it may impact any function steps that reference that field.

You can click
<Frame>
  ![](/images/c42c8998-image.jpeg)
</Frame>
when viewing a database table to open **Referenced By** and view any database operations that utilize that column first to understand where changes need to be made. In the screenshot below, we know we want to update the name column, so we can use **Referenced By** to find where it's used beforehand.

## üî¢ Adding Data

### Generate Test Data using AI

After you've created your database <Tooltip tip="Schema is just another way to refer to the collection of fields you've added to your database, and the type of data they expect.">schema</Tooltip>, you can generate some sample data to use right away by clicking

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/ed941e80-image.jpeg" />
</Frame>

This option is located at the **bottom** of your database records ‚Äî so, if you have no records, you should see it right at the top.

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/a48209cc-image.jpeg" />
</Frame>

The record generation will look at the name and the data type for each of your fields and try to auto-suggest what they should be filled with.

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/3907a803-image.jpeg" />
</Frame>

You can click on one of those data types to change what that field is populated with, or specific settings related to that data type.

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/6ee0b56f-image.jpeg" />
</Frame>

In the bottom-right corner, you can change the number of records generated, up to 100 at a time.

When you're ready, click "Generate" and you should see your new sample data populated. You can always generate more records if you'd like.

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/43b546eb-image.jpeg" />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  **Hint**

  Want to clear out all of the sample data? There's a quick "Clear All Records" shortcut in the upper-right settings menu. **This will delete all records in the table in one swing.**
</Tip>

### Adding Data Manually

Click
<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/185962de-image.jpeg" />
</Frame>
at the bottom of your existing records (if any) to add a new record.

The record will be created using any default values you've specified in the field options, and you can click on each cell to fill it in manually.

You can also click
<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/aaab2177-image.jpeg" />

| Versions          | Xano maintains a version history of your table schema. You can roll back to a previous version of your schema if you've made changes that you want to undo. **Note**: This does not change the data in your table, only the fields. If you need to restore a backup of your table data, see [this document](/xano-features/instance-settings/backup-and-restore). |

## Table Format

<Info>
  **Table Formats - Only relevant for direct database connections**

  As of our **1.68 release (5/27/25)**, all new workspaces will default to the standard SQL column format for tables. For all workspaces created prior to that, read below.
</Info>

Your tables can be created using one of two formats:

* **JSONB format**
  * This creates your tables with two columns:
    * `id` - the ID of the record
    * `jsonb` - contains a JSON representation of the entire record

* **Standard SQL format**
  * This creates a more standard table layout. Instead of a jsonb column, each column is written separately.

If you are using the [Direct Database Connector](/xano-features/instance-settings/direct-database-connector), Standard SQL format is usually recommended.

### Converting Tables from JSONB to standard SQL

<Warning>
This change is **permanent**. Most users will not need to adjust these settings, and they only impact your experience if you are connecting to your database directly via third-party tools.

</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="From your workspace dashboard, click the settings icon in the upper-right corner, and click Settings.">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scroll down to the Database Preferences section, and check the option to 'Use standard SQL columns for new tables'">
    <Frame caption="">
      <img src="/images/eb6ad281-image.jpeg" />
    </Frame>

    This setting must be enabled before you can convert existing tables to the new format.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Convert your table(s) from your workspace settings, or the settings of any table.">
    From the migration panel, select any of the tables you'd like to convert, and confirm your choices. The migration will begin immediately.

## Custom SQL Table Names

From your Workspace settings, you can enable **Custom SQL Table Names**.

By default, Xano assigns each table a SQL name in the format mvpw\_ (e.g., mvpw1\_3). This identifier works for direct access, but can be difficult to read or use with direct queries and database tools.

You can replace this with a custom SQL name to make queries more intuitive and improve compatibility with external connectors.

If you change a table's SQL name, be sure to update any queries that reference the old name to avoid breaking functionality.

Once you've enabled **Custom SQL Table Names**, head to any database table's settings, and click Manage next to SQL Table Name.

| | |
|-|-|
| <img src="/images/65aa79c8-image.jpeg" /> | - Leave the SQL Table Name field blank to use Xano‚Äôs default SQL table name, which follows the format mvpw\<workspaceID>\_\<tableID> (e.g., mvpw1\_3).<br/>- SQL table names must be globally unique across all workspaces. **Hint**: Use the Custom Prefix to ensure uniqueness across workspaces.<br/>- Datasources automatically add a suffix based on their environment. For example, **users** becomes **users\_test** in the test datasource.* To reuse the same base name across workspaces, use a workspace<br/>-specific prefix (e.g., projA\_users, projB\_users). |

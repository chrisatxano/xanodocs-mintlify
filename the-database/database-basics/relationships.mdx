<Info>
  **Quick Definition**

  Database relationships show how different tables of data connect to each other - like how a customer's ID links their personal information to their complete order history. These relationships can be one-to-one (one person, one social security number), one-to-many (one customer, many orders), or many-to-many (many students can take many classes).

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Types of Relationships

In Xano, there are three primary ways tables can be related:

#### 1. One-to-One

This is like a person and their unique passport. Each data entry in one table relates to exactly one entry in another table.

#### 2. One-to-Many

Think of a parent and their children. A single entry in one table can relate to multiple entries in another. For example, one teacher can teach many students.

#### 3. Many-to-Many

Similar to students enrolling in various courses, any entry in one table can relate to multiple entries in another.

## ‚ùì Why Use Relationships?

* **Data Consistency**: Ensures all references are valid.

* **Reduced Redundancy**: Minimizes repeated data.

* **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Makes it easier to access related data.

Understanding these basic concepts can simplify how you view databases and highlight why tools like Xano are powerful for managing data.

## üëÄ Using the Table Reference Field Type

When you add a table reference field to a database table, that field simply stores the IDs of the record(s) being referenced; the data is not actually duplicated. To access the actual data is typically done via an add-on as part of a function stack.

### Auto-Complete

Auto-Complete allows you to configure how the referenced records look inside of other tables.

For this example, we have two tables: `user` and `userRole`
